## Hi ðŸ‘‹

I'm Abdul, a PHP Laravel developer based in Birmingham, UK. <br>
I've developed bespoke solutions for the events and exhibitions industry focusing on client data management.
<br>

I love solving problems! <br>
I like to take a problem and break it up into smaller pieces and tackle each one at a time. <br>
A bit like a computer game, level 1 complete, level 2 complete, level 3 complete, hurrah you've unlocked 10k points and won Gold! <br>
When young, I'd wait for electrical items to stop working just so I could open it up and put it all back together again. Fun times!

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning TDD. It's super useful in the long run for your projects. I'd put it - Let the tests write your development.
- âš¡ In my spare time I like to 'php artisan' tinker with creating features ultimately helping people get things done faster.
- ðŸ”­ Below are some projects that I've been currently working on.
