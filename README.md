## Hi 👋

I'm Abdul, a Junior Developer focusing on Laravel / PHP / SQL.<br>
In my spare time I currently follow in order to improve my skills: Laracasts, Laravel News, Program With Gio and Laravel Daily.<br>
Currently based in Birmingham, UK soon to relocate to Manchester as of late July 2022. <br>
I've developed bespoke solutions for the events and exhibitions industry focusing on client data management.
<br>

🔨 I love solving problems! I like to take a problem and break it up into smaller pieces and tackle each one at a time. <br>
🖥️ A bit like playing a computer game, you start at level 1 and the challenge is to clock the game!<br>

🌱 I have a keen interest about TDD/PHPUnit and SOLID principles. It's super useful in the long run for your projects.<br>
🌱 Currently focusing on JS via Jonas Schmedtmann.<br>
⚡ I enjoy being a <sup>php artisan, tinker</sup>ing and creating features ultimately helping people get things done faster.<br>
