## Hi 👋

I'm Abdul, a Junior Backend Developer currently based in Birmingham, UK soon to relocate to Manchester. <br>
I've developed bespoke solutions for the events and exhibitions industry focusing on client data management.
<br>

🔨 I love solving problems! I like to take a problem and break it up into smaller pieces and tackle each one at a time. <br>
🖥️ A bit like playing a computer game! It's fun.<br>

🌱 I’m currently learning about TDD and SOLID principles. It's super useful in the long run for your projects. I'd put it - Let the tests write your development.<br>
⚡ I enjoy being a <sup>php artisan, tinker</sup>ing and creating features ultimately helping people get things done faster.<br>
🔭 Below are some projects that I'm currently working on focusing with Laravel / PHP. <br>
