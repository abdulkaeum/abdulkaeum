## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Abdul, a PHP Laravel developer based in Birmingham, UK.

I love solving problems! 
I like to take a problem and break it up into smaller pieces and tackle each one at a time. 
A bit like a computer game, level 1 complete, level 2 complete, level 3 complete, hurrah you've unlocked 10k points and won Gold!
Reminds me of when I was a kid, I'd wait for electrical items to stop working just so I could open it up and put it all back together again.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning TDD. It's super usefull in the long run for your projects. You should always write tests!
- âš¡ In my spare time I like to 'php artisan' tinker with tools and create features that help people get things done faster.
- ðŸ”­ Below are some projects that I've been currently working on.
